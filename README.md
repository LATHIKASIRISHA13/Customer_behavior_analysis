# Customer_behavior_analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis based on Python,SQL and Power BI.

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using an end-to-end data analytics approach. It involves data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard creation to uncover meaningful customer insights and support data-driven decision-making.

Dataset

The dataset is loaded and processed using Python.
It contains structured customer-related data.
Data cleaning is performed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning
PostgreSQL – Data storage and query execution
SQL – Analytical and aggregation queries
Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visualizations

Project Steps

Load the dataset using Python
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
Clean and preprocess the data
